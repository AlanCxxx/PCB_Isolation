# PCB_Isolation
A DeltaCad macro to convert a PCB B/W BMP image into a DXF isolation for CNC.

This macro will convert a BMP of a PCB (B/W please) into and isolation path for a CNC machine.

It has options for line thickness and image enhancement but best to start with a high resolution image if possible.

The DeltaCad macro language module does not work under Wine so windows only.
